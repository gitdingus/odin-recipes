        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p class="description">With a few simple ingredients you will be able to make an amazing grilled cheese sandwich. The only ingredients you need are bread, cheese, and butter.</p>
        <p class="description">I recommend cooking your grilled cheese in a cast iron skillet with a lid. It helps to have an egg timer close by so you don't burn your bread!</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 slices Canadian White Bread</li>
            <li>4 slices Boarshead Vermont Yellow Cheddar</li>
            <li>1 TBSP Salted Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Preheat the skillet over a medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 TBSP of butter to the pan and let it melt evenly over the surface</li>
            <li>Lower heat</li>
            <li>Put 4 slices of cheese in between your two slices of bread</li>
            <li>Place your sandwich on the skillet and cover with lid and set timer for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>When your two minutes are up take the sandwich off the skillet and melt the other 1/2 TBSP of butter on skillet</li>
            <li>Place your sandwich back in the skillet, covering with lid, on the uncooked side for two minutes</li>
            <li>Flip sandwich every two minutes until total cook time is eight minutes or bread is golden-brown and cheese is melted</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
